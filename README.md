### Greetings!
My name is Joel and I am learning full stack web development with Tech Elevator in the Part Time National Live Remote cohort. 

I enjoy art, heavy metal, and making experimental music on my modular synthesizer. I am currently a stay at home dad to an 18 month old and am seriously stoked on the future!
